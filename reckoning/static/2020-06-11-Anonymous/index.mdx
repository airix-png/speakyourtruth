| My friends and I are sick of it. At first I thought j was the only one, but it effects many black people everywhere. We're tired of being the only black people employed in corporate America. Forcing ourselves to fit in with everyone else each day at the office is exhausting. Then, we come home and have to code switch back to our normal selves because we know the white people won't feel comfortable if we act like our true selves. That had to come to an end and companies need to start investing in black staff immediately. Being "the only one" can get depressing after so long.
