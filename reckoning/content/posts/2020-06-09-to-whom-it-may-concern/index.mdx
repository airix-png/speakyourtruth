[[tldr | Hello,]]
| + **Speak Your Truth** was brought to life through the collaborative efforts of [PNG](https://instagram.com/passionnurturesgrowth) & [YONKO Productions] (https://instagram.com/yonkosteez)
| + **Mission:** To amplify voices and serve as a guide to sources of credible information
| + An **open space** to shed light on public & personal experiences of _racial injustice_, discuss, & reflect on the recognition of its impact on society.
| + We are launching two initiatives: 
|   + **SYT Blog** : [form for submissions here](https://formfacade.com/public/113895507355510215939/all/form/1FAIpQLScevERWDOtssGc-lK2nrYQtjTToP2xmdaWPmq_GwvWvEdTHbw)
|   + **SYT** [**Shirt**] (https://speakyourtruth.shop) : 100% of proceeds will be donated to [My Block My Hood My City] (https://www.formyblock.org/) and our SYT black artist grant fund. 


Throughout recent weeks, we have come to realize that the current events and uprising of frustrations are not merely a trend 
but a call to action. As a society we have failed the black community. 
It is our duty to seek justice for those unfairly treated and unspoken for; to make change, 
starting within ourselves, our communities, and eventually the world as a whole.    

[PNG](https://instagram.com/passionnurturesgrowth) & [YONKO Productions] (https://instagram.com/yonkosteez) 
have come together during this time, to seek a way to create momentum for this movement to continueâ€” to contribute through our craft. 
[speakyourtruth.me] (https://speakyourtruth.me) is a virtual space to _share stories, provide education, converse, express, and PITCH SOLUTIONS._

Half of the proceeds from our shirt sales will be donated to [My Block My Hood My City] (https://www.formyblock.org/). The other half will be put into a grant fund that will be passed on to a black artist. Once the money has been collected, we will post an application and deadline for this grant.
