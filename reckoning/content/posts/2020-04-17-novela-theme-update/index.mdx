[[tldr | Hello,]]
| + **Speak Your Truth** was brought to life through the collaborative efforts of [PNG](https://instagram.com/passionnurturesgrowth) & [YONKO Productions] (https://instagram.com/yonkosteez)
| + **Mission:** To amplify voices and serve as a guide to sources of credible information
| + A space for **Black communities and Allies** to shed light on personal experiences of _racial injustice_, or reflections on your recognition of its impact on society.
| + We are launching two initiatives: 
|   + **Voices Blog** : [form for submissions here](https://forms.gle/WbpSWDX6LUB5g8q89)
|   + **Speak Your Truth** [**Shirt**] (https://speakyourtruth.shop) : 100% of proceeds will be donated to a BLM Org and our SYT black creative fund
