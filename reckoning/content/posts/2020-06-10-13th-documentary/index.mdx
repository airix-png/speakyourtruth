### A compilation of some facts and takeaways 
*_**‘13th’** directed by **Ava DuVernay**_*


I noticed that a lot of people had not seen this documentary yet despite it going around as a resource, so I figured laying out the info like this could be useful. While I highly recommend watching the whole film, I realize that many people may not be able to give it the time, or some parts of it may be traumatizing, triggering, or too upsetting for some to sit through. This compilation is really just scratching the surface of what is stated in the film, but it’s a start! And if you’ve seen it already, I hope this is helpful in keeping the information fresh in your mind.

As with every documentary, ‘13th’ has its own narrative and may at times be factually biased, but it nonetheless gives a substantial amount of insight into the many issues in the U.S. criminal justice system. It’s also very visually, sonically, and emotionally engaging, so it’s worth watching for its craft in filmmaking as well!

In addition to Netflix, ‘13th’ is also available for free on YouTube. I’ve linked it in my bio!
