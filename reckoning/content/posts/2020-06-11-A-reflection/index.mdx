### [**_A Reflection_** | Nicholas Joseph] (https://instagram.com/nickjxseph)


**This week I sat in so much contemplation asking myself an array of questions.** 

Questions that honestly hurt: _“How can one willingly disregard life?”_, _“How can one act as if a life is not valuable?”_,  _“Will I have to mourn a family member?”_, and ultimately, 
###### **_“Could I be next?”_** 

_


I've mourned this week alongside so many others and have experienced a constant flux of emotions. 

As a Black American male constantly being reminded of the systematic disadvantages presented to people of my likeness, 
it's been heart wrenching to bear witness to the atrocities happening. 
However, what’s evident within itself is that **_these atrocities are not new._** 
Much hasn't changed in the span of more than 400 years. 
According to [Derrick Bell, American civil rights activist,] (http://www.visionaryproject.org/bellderrick/) we hit these “Peaks of Progress” in our fight for justice only for the cause to fade into irrelevance until the next instance of injustice. 
It’s a constant effort to inform, reform, and educate, sometimes to no avail. 

**But we can’t let up.**  

To clarify, the struggles that we as Black people endure are not limited to the experiences we have with law enforcement, 
but also the **day to day misconceptions** we face not based on our individual character but on our appearance. 
As a choreographer that has been blessed to travel, there are many times I’ve had to be hyper-aware of the way I presented myself abroad 
because I know what the media says about people that look like me. 

I get stares, looks, questions. Some out of innocent curiosity and others in contempt. 

Mind you, I maintain this hyper-awareness even while home in the states for obvious reasons. 
In addition, **all my life I’ve endured the _“Oreo”_ stereotype** because my interests, experiences and intelligence do not match the _“predominant”_ and so-called _“correct”_ narrative of a Black American male. 
You can already see the issue of being caught between two perspectives of how I _“should”_ act and be.  

But this much is true, if you don't know someone then you may make assumptions based on preconceived notions alone. 
**We all do it.** 
We put things in boxes to try to understand them but all too often we do so prematurely. 
And when we do this, wrongful labels are assigned and ideologies are formed and go through an endless cycle of transmittal lending to ongoing perceptions rooted in ignorance. 

The only thing to combat this ignorance is **knowledge, open-mindedness, and understanding.** 

As a Christian, I have been challenged in the midst of all this. 
I questioned the purpose of suffering, why must it be endured so long, and if there is a future for reconciliation. 
But I’m reminded of a line by the musician, Propaganda, in which he expresses that _“...It was a crooked system just like this that left the King of Kings bloodless...”_ 
and although at the time of Jesus’ crucifixion it seemed injustice prevailed, the plan God had for us to be reconciled to Him was accomplished. 

So in this time, I **pray for** and **CONTRIBUTE** to the hopeful realization of reconciliation amongst ourselves and the systems over us through utilizing _my voice, resources and talents._ 

##### I implore you to do the same.
